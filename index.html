                <h2>A few words from Benjamin about the course:</h2>
                <br />
                <p>''I have set out to create an in-depth breakdown of my entire editing workflow, featuring comprehensive insights into
                the latest advancements in Adobe Lightroom and how I use these tools to build intricate stylised photographic edits. Or
                to put it simply, how I transform my images into the recognizable art pieces I’ve come to be known for.
                
                I’ve built and refined my editing process over the last ten years, and it’s something that has evolved constantly during
                this time. The techniques I’ve learned through trial-and-error, and through thousands of hours at my computer, are what
                I aim to teach you in this masterclass.
                </p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Inside the course we will dive into three of my most recent expedition catalogs, working with images from Antarctica,
                Svalbard and Greenland.'

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Are beginners welcome?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Absolutely!
            I believe there's information in the course for people at all levels of photography. We will take a look the basics of
            Lightroom as well as my philosophy for composition and camera settings before working our way into in-depth technical
            editing processes.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Is the course Lightroom based?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This masterclass will focus specifically on Lightroom classic.
                We will go deep into every slider and mask in the develop module and how they can all work together for cohesive
                stylised edits. We will also be touching on a few additional techniques with Topaz Labs AI plugins and a section on
                Davinci Resolve for video reels.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>What can we expect?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                We'll be looking at my entire Adobe Lightroom workflow, from importing images and organising your shoot catalogs, to
                making selections, in depth masking processes and colour grading, then how I prepare and export images for use in print
                and social media.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Will I be able to rewatch the episodes in the future?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Yes! You will have lifetime access to the episodes, which will be available to watch on any device.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Does your editing course apply to other genres of photography?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
                We will be learning techniques that can be applied to any style of image. We'll also be looking at some of my commercial
                and portrait work for specific lessons on editing skin tones, products and how to incorporate brands into your trips.
